# CNC Experiments

I'm working on understanding gcode and how to realize designs through gcode
and scripting to generate gcode.

## Folders
### Camotics
The open source visualizer is my most recent tool to 
use for my experiments

https://camotics.org

### python
This folder contains scripts I'm using to generate the gcode
to put through the simulator

### python/lines
I'm starting a module called 'gcode' to manage the production of a gcode file.

The 'deepening_line_with_module.py' is an initial use of that module
